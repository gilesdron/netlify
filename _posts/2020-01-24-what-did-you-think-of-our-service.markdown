I found the site creation workflow straight forward. Not everything however worked out of the box as I encountered an issue using the deploy button.

I have detailed this issue on [https://ecstatic-varahamihira-1dad71.netlify.com/2020/01/23/site-creation-and-tools.html](https://ecstatic-varahamihira-1dad71.netlify.com/2020/01/23/site-creation-and-tools.html){:target="_blank"}.

I found the menu to be clear and concise. No additional coffee was required. I.E. I didn't have to look around too much to find what I needed.  

The deploy output was very useful.

A good experience.
