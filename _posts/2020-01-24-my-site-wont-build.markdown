If your site does not build resulting in an error please check if this builds successfully on your local development environment.    
This is an important step as if the site does not build locally then this needs resolving prior to deploying online.  

If the site builds OK locally but fails to deploy online then please confirm that the build versions match and that any dependencies are correctly defined in the configuration files.
Please also check the deploy log as this will display any build exceptions to help troubleshoot this issue.  

Documentation to help resolve the majority of build errors can be found at [https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/troubleshooting-tips/](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/troubleshooting-tips/){:target="_blank"}.
