I started looking at Rust the other day so this sprung to mind.

[https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started){:target="_blank"}

The page covers everything to get you up and running within minutes across multiple platforms, including dependencies which all to often require a bit more digging about.

The page was also distraction-free which I also like. As you can see this is a definite improvement from their previous homepage at [https://prev.rust-lang.org/en-US/](https://prev.rust-lang.org/en-US/){:target="_blank"}
